# Arbovirus Risk Prediction Project

This project leverages advanced machine learning to predict and assess arbovirus risks, including dengue, across multiple cities. By integrating weather data, temporal features, and sophisticated modeling, it provides actionable insights into potential outbreaks. Class imbalance issues are addressed prior to modeling to ensure robust predictions.

## Key Features

- **City-Level Risk Scoring**  
  Predictive categorization (Low, Medium, High) and feature importance analysis for each city.

- **Time Series Forecasting**  
  Using Prophet for multi-city predictions and statistical validation to forecast potential outbreaks.

- **Machine Learning Techniques**  
  - Random Forest classification  
  - Mutual information-based feature selection  
  - Advanced feature engineering  
  - Class imbalance handled prior to modeling to ensure reliable results
